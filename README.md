Sure, here's a brief summary of your Go CLI tool project:

### Project Overview

Your project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool written in Go (Golang) designed to perform various file manipulation tasks. The tool provides multiple functionalities which the user can select from a menu-driven interface.

### Key Functionalities

1. **List Directories**: Lists all files in a specified directory.
2. **Rename Files**: Renames files in a specified directory based on user input or a defined pattern.
3. **Move File**: [Not yet implemented] Moves a file from one directory to another.
4. **Create a New File**: [Not yet implemented] Creates a new file in a specified directory.
5. **Delete a File**: [Not yet implemented] Deletes a specific file from a directory.
6. **Exit**: Exits the application.

### Technical Details

- **Language**: The tool is written in Go, leveraging its strong support for file I/O operations and efficient handling of system-level tasks.
- **Command-Line Parsing**: It uses Go's `flag` package to parse command-line arguments.
- **Switch Case Logic**: The tool utilizes a `switch` statement to handle different user choices, making the code more organized and readable.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented to manage issues like file not found, permission errors, etc.

### Current Status and Future Enhancements

- As of now, the tool supports listing and renaming files. 
- The functionalities to move, create, and delete files are planned but not yet implemented.
- Future enhancements could include more advanced file manipulation features, user-friendly error messages, and performance optimizations.

This project is a practical application of Go's capabilities in building system-level tools, and it offers flexibility to be extended with additional features as required. It serves as a good learning exercise in Go, covering aspects like file handling, user input processing, and command-line interface design.
